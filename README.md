Unofficial app for booksy.com
=============================
![Screenshot](/assets/screenshot.png?raw=true)
A simple application that fetches available time slots to book from booksy.com and visualises them in the form of a calendar.
Maybe it isn't pretty, but what could you expect from a programmer?

Motivation
----------
Currently, Booksy's interface shows only one day at once. ~~And it takes forever to load another day.~~

Compiling
---------
1. You need OpenJDK 17
2. `./gradlew build`
3. Runnable fatjar will be in `build/libs`
